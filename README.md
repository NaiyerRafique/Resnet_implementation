# Resnet_implementation
The following is the pytorch implementation of the paper "Deep Residual Learning for Image Recognition". Residual networks make use of skip connections that simplifies the network and improves learning as we the neural network has fewer layers to navigate through during the learning phase.

## Improvements to me made
The followibng additions can be made to the existing code in the repository to improve the results.
1. Introducing weight decay.
2. Data augmentation.
3. Varying learning rate.
4. Changinh the number of epochs.
